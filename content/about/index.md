Railroader is security static analysis tool for
applications written using Ruby on Rails.

Railroader will examine your program to look for potential
problems, and warn you about them.
Railroader can't find every vulnerability, but it's a great tool to help
you find problems *before* they hurt anyone.
It is a *static* analysis tool - that means it does not try to run
the application you are analyzing.

Railroader is open source software (OSS) released under the MIT license.
We would *love* to have more contributions.
Please post issues (bug reports and ideas), as well as pull requests
for proposed changes, through our

Railroader is a fork of the Brakeman tool, which was once OSS but is no longer. If you want Brakeman, go to the
[Brakeman website](https://brakemanscanner.org/) instead.

We presume that the term "Brakeman" is trademarked by Synopsys, Inc.
Railroader is not Brakeman, though they share a common history.
If you find something in our documentation that incorrectly
implies that Railroader is Brakeman, please let us know so we can fix it.

Railroader is easy to [install](/install) and [use](/use).
So please do so!
