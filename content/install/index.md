Railroader is easy to use if you have any familiarity
with Ruby on Rails.

In your Ruby on Rails application, just modify
its `Gemfile` to include railroader, like this:

~~~~ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'railroader'
end
~~~~

Then install it the usual way using bundle:

~~~~ruby
bundle install
~~~~

That's it! You are ready to [use Railroader](/use).
