Rails applications tend to be complex and processing all possible scenarios is nearly impossible. Railroader is built with reliability in mind and always attempts to at least generate a report. Unfortunately, that can some times hide problems. 

Hopefully the information on this page can help when things go awry. Remember, you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/railroader/issues) or ask on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/david-a-wheeler/railroader) to get help.
