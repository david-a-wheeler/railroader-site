[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) (or [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org)) is a continuous integration tool.

A [Railroader plugin for Jenkins](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Railroader+Plugin) is available which will allow you to run Railroader automatically when code changes and report the results.

It will also produce trend graphs like this:

Check [here](/docs/jenkins/installation) for instructions on how to install the plugin.
