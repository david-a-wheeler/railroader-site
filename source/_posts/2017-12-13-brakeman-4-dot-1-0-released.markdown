### New Check for Dangerous Permit Keys

Very similar to warning about potentially dangerous keys in `attr_accessible`, Railroader now warns about potentially dangerous keys whitelisted for mass assignment via `params.permit`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1128))

### New Optional Check for Division by Zero

Previously, Railroader would report errors when it encountered potential division by zero. Now, it optionally reports warnings instead.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1122))

### Arel.sql

`Arel.sql` allows one to add raw SQL to queries. Railroader now warns about potential SQL injection when using `Arel.sql` with dynamic values.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1129))

### Sass Error Locations

Thanks to [Andrew](https://github.com/abrom), Railroader now reports actual file names for errors involving Sass.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1133))

### Temp Files

Railroader no longer warns about file access with `params[:blah].tempfile.path` or `params[:blah].path`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1121))

### Rails 5.2 CSRF Configuration

In Rails 5.2, CSRF protection is enabled by default. Railroader will now respect this.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1138))

### Attribute Combination Assignment

This release handles code like `x[:y] += 1` better. Previously, it would not update the value for `x[:y]`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1123))

### Nested Destructuring

Railroader now can handle nested multiple assignment, like `x, (a, b), y = z`, assuming `z` is known to be an array.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1113))

### Pager Updates

The default pager (`less`) now leaves the output in the terminal after exiting and now exits immediately if the output fits on the screen.

Additionally, Railroader attempts to detect if these options are actually supported by `less` before using them.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1112) and [here](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1120))

### CVE-2016-6316

In case this one was keeping you up at night, Railroader now reports the correct upgrade version for CVE-2016-6316.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1105))

### HTTPS for Warning Links

Links to railroaderscanner.org in reports are now HTTPS! Only makes sense.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1114))

### Code Climate Updates

The Railroader engine on [Code Climate](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/railroader) now supports `app_path` and `include_paths`, together.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1126))
