_Changes since 3.3.5_:

* Show obsolete ignore entries in reports ([Jonathan Cheatham](https://github.com/jcheatham))
* Add option to prune ignore file with `-I`
* Add new `plain` report format ([#914](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/914))
* Support creating reports in non-existent paths ([#924](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/924))
* Add `--no-exit-warn` ([#925](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/925))
* Improved Slim template support

### Obsolete Ignore Entries

The "ignore" configuration file can sometimes grow large due to stale entries that no longer correspond to existing warnings. Thanks to [Jonathan Cheatham](https://github.com/jcheatham), these obsolete entires will now be noted in the default and JSON reports.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/894))

When using the `-I` option it is now possible to prune the ignore file.

### New Report Format

This release adds a new "plain text" report format. It will eventually replace the default "table" report in Railroader 4.0.

To output in the new format, use `-f plain` or `-o report.plain`.

The color codes should be disabled automatically if outputing to a file, but `--no-color` can be used to turn colors off.

Feedback on the new report format is encouraged prior to the 4.0 release.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/935))

### Report Paths

If the specified output file is in a non-existent path, Railroader will now attempt to create the path before writing out the report.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/927))

### No Exit Code on Warnings

`--no-exit-warn` has been added to complement `--exit-warn`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/926))

### Improved Slim Support

Most users will not notice any changes, but internally Slim templates are handled a bit better.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/932) and [more](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/931))
