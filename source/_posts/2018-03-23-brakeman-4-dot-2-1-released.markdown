This is a small release to add warnings for [CVE-2018-3741](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/tP7W3kLc5u4/uDy2Br7xBgAJ) and [CVE-2018-8048](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/b__OeLG9bts/waZTvSM2AQAJ).

Please note there have been a number of vulnerabilities in the Rails HTML sanitization methods over the years. Only use sanitization when an application *must* accept and render HTML from an untrusted source. Otherwise, escape outputs instead.

_Changes since 4.2.0_:

* Add warning for CVE-2018-3741
* Add warning for CVE-2018-8048
* Scan `app/jobs/` directory
* Handle `template_exists?` in controllers ([#1124](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/1124))


### CVE-2018-3741

[CVE-2018-3741](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/tP7W3kLc5u4/uDy2Br7xBgAJ) is a vulnerability in the `rails-html-sanitizer` gem which may allow bypassing attribute whitelists and therefore cross-site scripting.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1171))

### CVE-2018-8048

[CVE-2018-8048](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/b__OeLG9bts/waZTvSM2AQAJ) is a similar vulnerability in the `loofah` gem.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1169))

### Scan Jobs

Railroader will now scan files in the `app/jobs/` directory and treat them as additional libraries.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1168))

### Template Guard Condition

Railroader will no longer warn about dynamic render paths if `template_exists?` is used as a guard condition.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1170))

### A Note on Vulnerabilities in Depdendencies

Railroader does not warn about *all* CVEs in application dependencies. There are many better tools that track and detect vulnerable dependencies.

Railroader only includes warnings about vulnerabilities announced on the [Rails Security Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/b__OeLG9bts/waZTvSM2AQAJ).
