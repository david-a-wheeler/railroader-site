### CVE-2014-0080

[CVE-2014-0080](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/Wu96YkTUR6s/pPLBMZrlwvYJ) is a SQL injection issue only affects applications using PostgreSQL with Rails 4.x. If Railroader detects the `pg` gem and an affected version, it will warn about this CVE.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/447))

### CVE-2014-0081

[CVE-2014-0081](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/tfp6gZCtzr4/j8LUHmu7fIEJ) is a vulnerability in `number_to_currency`, `number_to_percentage`, and `number_to_human`. Values passed in as options may not be properly escaped. It affects all previous versions of Rails.

Railroader will warn on unsafe uses of these methods. If no unsafe calls are found, it will generate a generic medium confidence warning.

Warnings for CVE-2014-0081 replace warnings for CVE-2013-6415, which was about just `number_to_currency`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/448))

### CVE-2014-0082

[CVE-2014-0082](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/LMxO_3_eCuc/ozGBEhKaJbIJ) is a potential symbol denial of service problem when handling `render :text` in Rails 3.x.

Railroader will only warn about this CVE if it detects use of `render :text` in affected versions.
