This is a small release prompted by Tuesday's CVE announcements. New checks for the CVEs directly in Rails have been added, and can also test for the suggested workarounds. Please consider using [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) for detecting known vulnerable versions of gems, as Railroader has only limited coverage.

Note this release also upgrades the RubyParser dependency. The latest RubyParser has several bug fixes and initial support for new Ruby 2.2 syntax.

*Changes since 3.0.3*:

* Add check for CVE-2015-3226 (XSS via JSON keys)
* Add check for CVE-2015-3227 (XML DoS)
* Treat `<%==` as unescaped output ([#661](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/661))
* Update `ruby_parser` dependency to 3.7.0

### Cross Site Scripting in JSON

[CVE-2015-3226](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/7VlB_pck3hU/3QZrGIaQW6cJ) is an issue with converting hashes to JSON. The keys do not properly escape HTML entities, leading to potential cross site scripting vulnerabilities. Railroader will warn unless the workaround is included in an initializer (essentially verbatim). The warning is high confidence if there is evidence of explicitly converting values to JSON, otherwise medium.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/665))

### XML Denial of Service

[CVE-2015-3227](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/bahr2JLnxvk/x4EocXnHPp8J) is a potential denial of service when parsing deeply nested XML requests. Railroader will warn about this unless there is an initializer changing the XML parser as described in the CVE. Currently it looks for either `LibXML` or `Nokogiri`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/666))

### Double Equals is Unescaped Output

Railroader will now treat `<%== x %>` in ERB templates as unescaped output.
