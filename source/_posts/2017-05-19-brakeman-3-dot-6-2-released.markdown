*Changes since 3.6.1:*

* Remove `--rake` option
* By default, do not honor additional check paths in config
* Properly handle template names without `.html` or `.js`
* Catch YAML parsing errors in session settings check ([#1046](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/1046))
* Better handling of `if` expressions in HAML rendering ([#1032](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/1032))
* Avoid warning about SQLi with `to_s` in `exists?` ([#1045](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/1045))
* Handle safe call operator in checks ([#1031](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/1031))
* Handle empty `if` expressions when finding return values
* Set template file names during rendering for better errors
* Limit Slim dependency to before 3.0.8
* Update RubyParser to 3.9.0

### Rake Option Removed

The Rake task generated by `--rake` has caused quite a few problems. When Rake is run with a Rails application, it loads all of the app's dependencies, which may conflict with Railroader's dependencies.

It is recommended to either not use a Rake task to run Railroader or just shell out to Railroader instead of using it as a library.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1038))

### Check Paths in Config Files

Railroader allows loading custom checks with `--add-checks-path`.
To avoid silently loading arbitary code, Railroader will not support this option in configuration files unless explicitly enabled with `--allow-check-paths-in-config`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1052))

### Templates without Format Extension

The [3.5.0 release](http://railroaderscanner.org/blog/2017/01/31/railroader-3-dot-5-0-released/) added support for templates with a bare extension (like `my_template.haml`) but template names derived internally did not handle these bare extensions properly. When rendering templates, Railroader was not able to match render names to the correct files.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1041))

### YAML Errors

When checking session settings, Railroader parses `config/secrets.yml`. Sometimes this file has unsafe values or interpolated code which causes the parsing to fail. Railroader will now only output a notice about this failure instead of an error.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1047))

### If Expressions in HAML

Typically Railroader assumes all `if` branches in templates are taken and ignores the condition. This was not happening in all cases in rendered HAML templates.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1035/files))

### `to_s` False Positive with `exists?`

Railroader will no longer warn about arguments calling `to_s` in `exists?`, since that is the recommended way to avoid SQL injection with that particular method.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1049))

### Better Safe Call Handling

The safe call operation `&.` will be handled better in all checks instead of being ignored.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1033))

### Empty Ifs

This release fixes an issue when finding return values from methods ending in an empty `if` expression.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1053))

### More Template Names

Template file names will now be set when passing code to template rendering libraries, in order to produce better error messages when something goes wrong.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1042))

### Dependencies

RubyParser has been updated to `3.9.0` which resolves some issues.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1048))

Slim is limited to `<3.0.8` since the `3.0.8` gem requires Ruby 2.0.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/1050))
